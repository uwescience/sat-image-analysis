### Satellite Image Analysis Special Interest Group

**Meeting Time:**  *October 18th (Thursday), 12:00pm - 1:00pm*

**Location:** *[WRF Data Science Studio](https://www.google.com/maps/place/eScience+Institute/@47.6536832,-122.3135565,16z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x549014f277b0f15d:0x7c2434f079426d8c!8m2!3d47.6533665!4d-122.3117848), UW Physics/Astronomy Tower, 6th floor*


With the rise of publicly available satellite imagery data sets provided by both federal institutions and private companies, opportunities have grown to use these data sets to answer questions in a variety of domains (geosciences, social sciences, urban studies, etc).

Satellite and other aerial images can provide observations of the Earth at very high spatial and temporal resolution, but with that come challenges around managing large scale data sets and extracting relevant information from high-dimensional data. 

**Group Objectives:**

* Build a community of users of satellite/aerial imagery 
* Learn about each other’s work
* Learn about state-of-the-art methods and tools for large scale data processing and computer vision
* Identify common challenges in accessing, processing, and analyzing satellite/aerial imagery
* Together build software tools and advance the methodology in the domain


During the first meeting we will discuss what activities we can engage in as a group: tutorials, scientific discussions and tool exploration. We welcome participants from any domain across campus. We plan on having biweekly meetings during the quarter. A hackathon will also be held in the beginning of Winter Quarter for participants and collaborators to spend some focused time working on projects together.
