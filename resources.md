Satellite imagery is new to me, where can I start learning about it?
[newcomers earth observation-guide]https://business.esa.int/newcomers-earth-observation-guide

I'd like information about a particular satellite mission!
* [satellite mission database](https://directory.eoportal.org/web/eoportal/satellite-missions)

I'd like to search for and download free satellite imagery for an area of interest!
* [NASA Earthdata search](https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search)
* [ESA Copernicus data](https://scihub.copernicus.eu/)

I'd like to access high-resolution, high-temporal sampling proprietary imagery!
* [Planet academic data access](https://www.planet.com/markets/education-and-research/)
* [DigitalGlobe/Maxar open data](https://www.digitalglobe.com/ecosystem/open-data)

I'd like to work with satellite imagery on commercial cloud computing infrastructure!
* [geospatial data on AWS](https://registry.opendata.aws/?search=tags:gis,earth%20observation,events,mapping,meteorological,environmental,transportation)
* [Google Earth Engine catalog](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/)
* [Public data on Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/public-datasets/)

I'm a student looking for scholarships for data access   
* [USGIF Scholarships](https://usgif.org/education/scholarships) for grad students, several should be for data access

Machine Learning
---
What machine learning problem.
What are the inputs and outputs of the system?
What is the format of your labels?
Is it points, regions/masks, labels associated with images?
Do you plan to treat pixels as individual observations, or images as individual observations?
