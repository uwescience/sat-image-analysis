## Sat-Hack 2019

The eScience Institute will be hosting a Satellite Imagery Hackday on **Nov 14 -  Nov 16, 2019**. Join us for an entire day dedicated to working on exciting satellite imaging/remote sensing projects!

Do you have a pressing satellite imagery problem? Do you want to try out a new tool on a familiar dataset or explore a new dataset? This hackday is for you to collaborate intensively with other students and researchers on similar challenges. We welcome hacking on data from any Earth observation system (satellites, airplanes, drones,  etc.). As long as you think that there can be some common language regarding tools and methods, join us!

#### Schedule: 

  **Thursday (Nov 14), 4:00pm - 7:00pm:** We will pitch project ideas, form hack teams and start hacking! Pizza will be provided!
  
  **Friday (Nov 15), 8:30am - 5:00pm:** Hacking!
  
  **Friday (Nov 15), 5:00pm - 6:00pm:** Sharing!
  
  **Saturday (Nov 16), 9:00am - 5:00pm** More Hacking!  

The Data Science Studio will remain open for as long as needed on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. 

Please, RSVP [here](https://forms.gle/JyZFY9sugBhfpH1N8) by Nov 8. We encourage you to brainstorm hack ideas ahead of time. You can share them in this [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jfzCyGZVi8_c521N2tqxtBzI2ngS2LEn2ISuT-dtBAA/edit?usp=sharing) or sign up for [slack](https://sat-image-analysis.slack.com/) and join the #sat-hack2019 channel.
