## SatHack 2019

The eScience Institute will be hosting a Satellite Imagery Hackday on May 2 -  May 3, 2019. Join us for an entire day dedicated to working on exciting satellite imaging/remote sensing projects!

Do you have a a pressing satellite imagery problem? Do you want to try out a new tool on a familiar dataset or explore a new dataset? This hackday is for you to collaborate intensively with other students and researchers on similar challenges. We welcome hacking on data from any Earth observation system (satellites, airplanes, drones,  etc.) As long as you think that there can be some common language regarding tools and methods, join us!

#### Schedule: 

  **Thursday, 4:00pm - 7.00pm:** We will pitch project ideas, form hack teams and start hacking! Pizza will be provided!
  
  **Friday, 8.30am - 5.00pm:** Hacking!
  
  **Friday, 5:00pm - 6pm:** Share your progress.

The Data Science Studio will remain open for as long as needed on Thursday and Friday.
